# How to Contribute to the Prism Format

We are happy about your interest in contributing! All help is welcome. This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to the Prism format specification.

## How Can I Help?

### Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements

If you find an error in the documentation, an inconsistency in the specification, or have an idea for an enhancement, the best way to let us know is by opening an **Issue** on the GitHub repository.

When opening an issue, please provide as much detail as possible:

*   **For Bugs:** Describe the problem, where it occurs (which file and line), what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.
*   **For Suggestions:** Describe your suggestion in detail and explain why it would be beneficial to the format.

### Proposing Changes to the Specification

For more substantial changes, such as adding a new `Aspect` or altering the syntax, the process is as follows:

1.  **Open an Issue for Discussion:** Before any implementation, open an issue so the proposal can be discussed by the community. This ensures that the changes are aligned with the project's philosophy.
2.  **Create a Pull Request:** Once the proposal has been discussed and approved, you can create a *Pull Request* with the changes to the relevant documentation files (e.g., in `docs/specification.md`).

### Adding Examples

We have an `examples/` directory to demonstrate the use of the format. If you have a good example of a use case that is not yet covered, feel free to open a Pull Request adding your `.prism` file.

## Style Guidelines

*   **Documentation:** Use standard Markdown syntax.
*   **`.prism` Examples:** Please follow the recommendations described in `docs/best-practices.md` to maintain consistency.
