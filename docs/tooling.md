# Tooling Suggestions for the .prism Format

To accelerate adoption and facilitate the use of the `.prism` format, the development of support tools is crucial.

## 1. Visual Studio Code Extension

A VS Code extension is the highest priority for tooling.

*   **Essential Features:**
    *   **Syntax Highlighting:** Colorize the different components of the syntax (`@entity`, `@@aspect`, keys, values, comments) to improve readability.
    *   **Snippets:** Shortcuts to quickly create new `.prism` files or new aspect blocks.
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Linter:** Integrate a linter that checks the syntax in real-time, pointing out errors like missing required keys or absent `---` delimiters.
    *   **Autocomplete:** Suggest aspect names, keys, and enum values (like `status` or `impact_level`).
    *   **Preview:** A preview panel that renders the `.prism` file in a format similar to the platform's Entity Viewer.

## 2. Command-Line Linter

*   **Purpose:** A command-line tool to validate the syntax of `.prism` files, useful for integration with automation scripts and CI/CD.
*   **Functionality:** Takes one or more `.prism` files as input and points out syntax errors, returning an appropriate exit code (0 for success, >0 for error).

## 3. Entity Generator (Web UI)

*   **Purpose:** A web tool, possibly integrated into the User Dashboard, that offers a form to fill out an entity's aspects and generates the corresponding `.prism` file.
*   **Benefit:** Reduces the learning curve of the syntax for new users.

## 4. Parser Library in JavaScript/TypeScript

*   **Purpose:** Publish the official parser as an open-source library (npm package).
*   **Benefit:** Allows the community to create their own tools and integrations that read and manipulate `.prism` files consistently.
